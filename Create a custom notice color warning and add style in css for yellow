/*************
Creating a Custom Notice Style in WooCommerce
Previously I showed the three different types/styles of notices you can use within WooCommerce. If wanted you can also add your own style. To accomplish this you’d have to do three things.

The first one is to create a new template file / copy an existing one to your (child) theme. I’d suggest copying one of the existing files in the woocommerce/templates/notices/path to use as a starting point. Add this as a new file in your theme directory under woocommerce/notices/warning.php.
Change the class attribute in the file to woocommerce-message woocommerce-warning so we can use that in later on.

Next you’d also have to add some styling to ensure the new notice is distinctive from the rest and actually looks the way you want. Here’s a sample of what I’m using

.woocommerce-warning {
    background-color: #e89b0e;
}
Lastly you’d have to add the new notice type to the notice types that are outputted automatically.

function ace_register_new_notice_type( $types ) {
    $types[] = 'warning';
	
	return $types;
}
add_filter( 'woocommerce_notice_types', 'ace_register_new_notice_type' );
Now that the template exists and the styling is setup you can call your new notice style with the following code wc_add_notice( 'My warning notice', 'warning' );

Note that the second argument should match the filename (minus the .php)
